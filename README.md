A [fictional] General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feed for the historical Scioto Valley Traction Company.

This is a small hobby project -- to create a fictional (but heavily based in real historical sources) transit feed for the Scioto Valley Traction Company, which operated interurban electric trains between Columbus, Chillicothe, and Lancaster, Ohio.

The primary basis of this schedule will be the 1914 Scioto Valley Traction Company timetable available at columbusrailroads.com as well as the maps available at railsandtrails.com. My thanks to Alex Campbell and Stephen Titchenal, respectively, for their amazing websites and resources.
