A [fictional] General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feed for the historical Scioto Valley Traction Company.

This is a small hobby project -- to create a fictional (but heavily based in real historical sources) transit feed for the Scioto Valley Traction Company, which operated interurban electric trains between Columbus, Chillicothe, and Lancaster, Ohio.

The schedule is based on various timetables available on the web as well as the maps available at railsandtrails.com. My thanks to Alex Campbell at columbusrailroads.com and Stephen Titchenal at railsandtrails.com for their amazing websites and resources.
